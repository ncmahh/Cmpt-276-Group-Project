Abstract

The application uses the Google Maps API along with the Google fitness API to provide the combined benefits of the applications. The main purpose of the app is to improve scheduling by automatically including items the user often overlooks. These can be selected from lists provided that include default scheduling frequencies or they may be manually inputted. These items are then inserted into open slots in the user's schedule. When a user misses an event that item will be automatically rescheduled for a later time. The role of the Maps API is to account for travel time when automatically scheduling. Furthermore, the user can choose to make use of the fitness option that will also include workouts in the schedule as well as track progress that influences the length/ frequency of workouts that are scheduled. 


Customer

The app is created for people who are less inclined to utilize lists and schedules for greater organization. This is why after the initial input of their schedule it is predominantly automatic. While the app is intended for those who may dislike the process of scheduling the ease and extensiveness of the schedules may also appeal to those who regularly employ similar tools. 


Competitive Analysis

The competing programs are the already existing calendar apps and fitness apps. What differentiates this is that it consolidates both of these into one place along with focused lists that can automatically and dynamically be incorporated into the userâ€™s schedule.

User Stories

The user is first prompted for either login information or the option to make an account. If the user chooses the option to create an account they will be directed to a new page where they will input the required information before being forwarded to the home screen. Otherwise, the user will proceed straight to the home screen. 
Next, the user will have the option of creating a new calendar or accessing one in use. If the user chooses to create a new one they will be directed to a blank calendar. There will be several options to look through lists of automatic tasks that can be selected to add themselves to the schedule. The user may also add their own items by clicking on a day and inputting the information. 
There will also be tab the user may click on to access the fitness portion of the site. Here they will input the required information and select several options to tailor how workouts are scheduled. In this section, they will also be able to access progress data.
